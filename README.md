[![ESP32-based environment sensing robot controller][controller-render]](https://github.com/jonshung/esp32-sensing-robot/)
<br/>
A small project that I've been working on in the summer, which consists of a codebase for an ominiwheel, automatically controlled robot for fast and accurate environment sensing; along with a simple manual controller for the robot using another esp32 module with onboard MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope IC.
<br/><br/>
Warning: the project is not completed and only automatic mode is available at the moment
